# Pterodactyl Eggs Repository

This repository is a collection of Pterodactyl eggs that I use. Pterodactyl eggs are JSON files that define the server configuration for the Pterodactyl Panel, a free and open-source game server management panel.

## Contents

The eggs in this repository are mostly not written by me. They are collected from various sources and authors. However, some of them have been modified to suit my specific needs.

## Modifications

The modifications made to the eggs include changes to the server configurations, such as the server settings, startup commands, and environment variables. These changes are made to optimize the performance of the servers and to customize them according to my requirements.

## Usage

To use these eggs, you need to have the Pterodactyl Panel installed on your server. Once you have the panel installed, you can import these eggs into the panel and use them to create new servers.



## Disclaimer

Please note that while I strive to ensure that all eggs in this repository are safe to use, I cannot guarantee their safety or effectiveness. Please use them at your own risk.

## License

Unless otherwise stated, the eggs in this repository are licensed under the same license as the original eggs they were based on. If an egg does not have a license specified, please assume it is licensed under the MIT License.
